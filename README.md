STARK - Spark on Tez
============

> IMPORTANT: At the time or writing, the project represents a **_prototype_** with the goal of demonstrating 
the validity of the approach described in [SPARK-3561](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-3561). 
Functionality is limited but rapidly updated. For the list of what is currently available as well as short 
samples please refer to [Functionality](Functionality). 

==

**_STARK_** project represents an extension to [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) which enables DAGs assembled using SPARK API to run on [Apache Tez](http://tez.apache.org/),
thus allowing one to benefit from native features of Tez, especially related to large scale Batch/ETL applications.

Aside from enabling SPARK DAG execution to run on [Apache Tez](http://tez.apache.org/), this project provides additional functionality which addresses developer productivity including but not limited to:
 * _executing your code directly from the IDE (Eclipse and/or IntelliJ)_
 * _transparent classpath management_ 
 * _seamless and simplified integration with mini-cluster environment_ 
 * _ability to place breakpoints in SPARK code to facilitate debugging when using mini-cluster (see InJvmContainerExecutor provided with [mini-dev-cluster](https://github.com/hortonworks/mini-dev-cluster))_
 
At the moment of writing, STARK is dependent on modifications to SPARK code described in [SPARK-3561](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-3561). 
This means that to use it, one must have a custom build of Spark which incorporates pending [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/2422).

Below are the directions on how to get started.

> NOTE: Please follow the pre-requisite described below and then continue to [**_Getting Started_**](https://github.com/hortonworks/spark-on-tez/wiki/Home) guide.

#### Checkout and Build SPARK-3561
```
$> git clone https://github.com/olegz/spark-1.git
$> cd spark-1
$> git fetch --all
```

Switch to SPARK-3561 branch

```
$> git branch --track SPARK-HADOOP origin/SPARK-HADOOP
$> git checkout SPARK-HADOOP
```
Spark uses Maven for its build so it must be present. And to ensure there are no OOM errors set up Maven options as below. 
See [Spark's documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/building-with-maven.html) for more details.

```
export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx2g -XX:MaxPermSize=512M -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=512m"
```

##### Build and install SPARK-3561 into your local maven repository

```
$> mvn -Pyarn -Phadoop-2.4 -Dhadoop.version=2.4.0 -DskipTests clean install
```
The build should take 20-30 min depending on your machine. You should see a successful build
```

##### Clone STARK

```
$> git clone https://github.com/hortonworks/stark.git
$> cd stark
```

This completes the pre-requisite required to run STARK and you can now 
continue to [**_Getting Started_**](https://github.com/hortonworks/spark-on-tez/wiki/Home) guide.
